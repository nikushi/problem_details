# ProblemDetails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nikushi/problem_details.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nikushi/problem_details) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/problem_details.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/problem_details)

ProblemDetails is an implementation of [RFC7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).

The RFC defines a "problem detail" as a way to inform errors to clients as machine readable form in a HTTP response
to avoid the need to define new error response formats for HTTP APIs.

This library also works with Rails and Sinatra, by the `problem` renderer that helps to respond with the problem detail form.

Currently only JSON serialization is supported.

## Features

* Provides the class that implements a Problem Details JSON Object.
* With Rails, automatically adds the renderer to respond with `Content-Type: application/problem+json` which works with `render` in controllers.

## Supported Versions

* Ruby 2.0.0, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x
* Rails 4.x, 5.x
* Sinatra >= 1.4

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'problem_details'
```

Or if you use with Rails, add below line instead.

```ruby
gem 'problem_details-rails'
```

With Sinatra, add below line instead.

```ruby
gem 'sinatra-problem_details'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Build a problem

```ruby
require 'problem_details'

ProblemDetails::Document.new(status: 404).to_json

# Or status code symbol can be specified as well.
ProblemDetails::Document.new(status: :not_found).to_json
```

will produce:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404
}
```

As above, the value of `type` will be presented as `about:blank` by default if the value is ommited, also the value of `title` is filled automatically from the status code. These are described in [Predefined Problem Types](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807#section-4.2):

> The "about:blank" URI, when used as a problem type, indicates that the problem has no additional semantics beyond that of the HTTP status code.

> When "about:blank" is used, the title SHOULD be the same as the recommended HTTP status phrase for that code (e.g., "Not Found" for 404, and so on)

But you may also have the need to add some little hint, e.g. as a custom detail of the problem:

```ruby
ProblemDetails::Document.new(status: 503, detail: 'Database not reachable').to_json
```

will produce:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Service Unavailable",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Database not reachable"
}
```

You can build a problem with any additional members which are described as [extension members](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807#section-3.2).

```ruby
ProblemDetails::Document.new(
  status: :forbidden,
  type: 'https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit',
  balance: 30,
  accounts: ['/account/12345', '/account/67890'],
).to_json
```

will produce(note that `balance` and `accounts` are extention members):

```json
{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "balance": 30,
  "accounts": [
    "/account/12345",
    "/account/67890"
  ]
}
```

### With Rails

Once `problem_details-rails` gem is installed into a Rails system, a problem can be rendered with the problem detail form with `Content-Type: application/problem+json`.

For example, respond with validation error messages:

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/posts_controller.rb
class Api::PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @post = Post.new(params[:post])
    if @post.save
      render json: @post
    else
      render problem: { errors: @post.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end
```

With `render problem: { ... }`, generated HTTP response will be like:

```
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Unprocessable Entity",
  "status": 422,
  "errors": {
    "body": [
      "can't be blank"
    ]
  }
}
```

### With Sinatra

Install `sinatra-problems_details` into a sinatra app, a problem is be rendered as well with `Content-Type: application/problem+json`.

#### Classic Application

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra-problem_details'

get '/' do
  status 400
  problem foo: 'bar'
end
```

#### Modular Application

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra-problem_details'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::ProblemDetails

  get '/' do
    status 400
    problem foo: 'bar'
  end
end
```

#### Response

The sinatra apps defined in the previous sections will render:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
